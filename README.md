# 🚀 Azure DevOps CI/CD Deployment — Node.js App on Azure App Service

This repository contains **end-to-end documentation** for deploying a **Node.js application** to **Azure App Service** using **Azure DevOps**, **Self-Hosted Agents**, **PostgreSQL Flexible Server**, and **Azure Front Door**.

It is structured as multiple markdown files under `docs/`, with images stored under `Images/`.

This README gives a clean, high-level overview of the entire deployment workflow.

# 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a **production-grade cloud deployment workflow** using:

- Azure App Service (Application Hosting)  
- Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server (Database)  
- Azure Front Door (Global Routing)  
- Azure VM (Self-Hosted DevOps Agent)  
- Azure DevOps Pipelines (CI/CD)  
- Resource Group (Resource Organization)

Each component is fully documented with screenshots and step-by-step instructions.

# 🧱 Architecture Components

This deployment uses the following Azure resources:

| Component                | Purpose                                         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Resource Group**       | Logical grouping for all Azure resources        |
| **PostgreSQL Flexible Server** | Application database with HA/DR capabilities |
| **Virtual Machine (VM)** | Acts as the self-hosted agent for Azure DevOps  |
| **App Service**          | Hosts the Node.js application                   |
| **Azure Front Door**     | Global load balancing + routing                 |
| **Azure DevOps Pipelines** | CI/CD pipeline for automated build & release |
